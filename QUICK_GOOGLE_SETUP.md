## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **New sites take time**: Even after submitting, Google needs 1-4 weeks to index
2. **You MUST submit**: Just having a website isn't enough - you need Google Search Console
3. **Verification required**: Google needs to verify you own the site
4. **Keep it updated**: Update content regularly to help rankings

## 💡 Need Help?

**If you need the verification code added:**
1. Get the HTML tag from Google Search Console
2. It looks like: `<meta name="google-site-verification" content="ABC123..." />`
3. Give me the `content` value and I'll add it

**If site still not showing after 4 weeks:**
- Check Google Search Console for errors
- Make sure sitemap is submitted
- Request indexing again
- Check for crawl errors
